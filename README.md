# Anne's testing stuffies

This skeleton is used for me to test different tools, to see what can I do with them.

For the moment:

- Vite + Typescript + React
- PWA
- CSR
- Medium/advanced arch for react
- Api example with suspense
- Vercel deploy
- Eslint + prettier with some basic rules
- Vitest with unit and integration tests

Ideas...
 - Adding a store
- Eject components into components lib, all in monorepo ðŸ§ 
- i18next
- Virtualization
- Animations
- [React Query and TansStack suff ðŸ˜Ž](https://tanstack.com/)
